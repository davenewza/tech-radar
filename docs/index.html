  <h3>What is the Technology Radar?</h3>

  <p>
    At <a href="http://www.whereismytransport.com">WhereIsMyTransport</a>, we maintain a Technology Radar to help our engineering team align on technology choices. It provides us with a structured approach to how we assess, adopt, and retire programming languages & frameworks, platforms, tools, and techniques. It also serves as a excellent way to communicate our technology stack to the outside world.
  </p>

</td><td>

  <h3>Credits</h3>

  <p>
    The Technology Radar is based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work by ThoughtWorks</a>. We've made some adjustments by amending the definition and description of the rings, similar to what has been done by the folks at <a href="https://github.com/red-gate/Tech-Radar">Redgate</a>.

  <h3>What are the quadrants?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Languages, Frameworks & Tools</strong> — The programming languages and frameworks we use to build our products, and the tools that allow us to get things done.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — The infrastructure required to host, control and manage the running of our applications, such as cloud providers, containerisation technologies, monitoring, DNS and CDN services, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Management</strong> — Technologies for storing and transmitting data, such as database platforms, caching providers and queue services.</li>
    <li><strong>Techniques</strong> — These include elements of the software development process, such as continuous deployment; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.</li>
  </ul>

</td><td>

  <h3>What are the rings?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adopt</strong> — This is a technology we should choose to solve a problem, where applicable. Everything in here forms part of our default set of technology choices.</li>
    <li><strong>Assess</strong> — This technology has potential and is worth experimenting with and trialing.  Could also be a candidate for an X-Lab project, SoapBox session, or Lunch & Learn presentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Endure</strong> — This is no longer how we do things. It is acceptable for this to still be used in development where it is a standard, but don't adopt it for new endeavours.</li>
    <li><strong>Retire</strong> — Do not use this technology because either we are deprecating it, it's not a good fit for our team, or because we have chosen a better alternative. If we are using it then we should be spending some time migrating away from it.</li>
  </ul>
