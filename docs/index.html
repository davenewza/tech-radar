  <h3>What is the Technology Radar?</h3>

  <p>
    At <a href="http://www.whereismytransport.com">WhereIsMyTransport</a>, we maintain a Technology Radar to help our engineering team align on technology choices. It provides us with a structured approach to how we assess, adopt, and retire programming languages & frameworks, platforms, tools, and techniques. It also serves as a excellent way to communicate our technology stack to the outside world.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work by ThoughtWorks</a>. We've made some adjustments by amending the definition and description of the rings, similar to what has been done by the folks at <a href="https://github.com/red-gate/Tech-Radar">Redgate</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the quadrants?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Languages and Frameworks</strong> — The programming languages and frameworks we use to build our products and tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools</strong> — These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Platforms</strong> — Things that we build software on top of, such as runtime and development platforms, like .NET Core, mobile technologies like Android, or virtual platforms like the JVM.</li>
    <li><strong>Techniques</strong> — These include elements of the software development process, such as continuous deployment; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What are the rings?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adopt</strong> — This is a technology you should choose to solve a problem, where applicable. Everything in here forms part of our default set of technology choices.</li>
    <li><strong>Explore</strong> — This technology has potential and is worth experimenting with during growth time (i.e. an X-Lab project, SoapBox session, or Lunch & Learn presentation) and/or by trialing on a prototype project or something similar.</li>
    <li><strong>Endure</strong> — This is no longer how we do things. It is acceptable for this to still be used in development where it is a standard on existing projects or products, but don't adopt it for new endevours, and consider migrating away from it wherever possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Retire</strong> — Don't use this technology! If you are using it then you should be spending some time migrating away from this.</li>
  </ul>
